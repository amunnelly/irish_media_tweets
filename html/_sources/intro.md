# A Week of Tweets from Major Irish Media Entities

This is an examination of the tweets tweeted (sent? posted?) by four national Irish media organisations during the first week of May, 2022. The organisations are:

* RTÃ‰ News
* The Irish Independent
* The Irish Examiner
* The Journal (Dot IE)


## An Issue with The Irish Times

The data were collated in the last full week in May, 2022. At the start of the week, there was no problem accessing the Irish Times tweets. At the end of the week, when testing had finished and I looked at a bigger tweet selection, all I got back from the Irish Times was `[{"meta": {"result_count": 0}}]`. I have no idea why, and had no option but to proceed without them.
